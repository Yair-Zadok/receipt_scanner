This is a project made to reduce the time manually spent inputting receipt data, by moving the human from data entry to data validation.

This done by first prompting GPT-4-vision for its opinion of the receipt data, then providing the human with a GUI for data validation which sends off the data to QuickBooks servers.
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The project is currently in the prototype stage, thus I've provided some preview code of how its going.

A Python, TKinter prototype has been finished and is present at directory 'python_prototype' along with an image of it's GUI.

Most of the development effort has been focused on building a website version of this prototype which interacts directly with the QuickBooks API.

The locations for various components of the website can be found at:
    -Database: at directory 'godeeby' 
    -Backend: at directory 'receipt_backend' 
    -Frontend: at directory 'receipt_frontend'
